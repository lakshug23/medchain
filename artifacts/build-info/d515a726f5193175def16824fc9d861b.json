@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.

functions deal with verification of Merkle Tree proofs. The tree and the proofs can be generated using our https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree[JavaScript library]. You will find a quickstart guide in the readme. WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box. IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions that access memory in an unsafe way. NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires additional logic that is not supported by this library.\",\"errors\":{\"MerkleProofInvalidMultiproof()\":[{\"details\":\"The multiproof provided is not valid.\"}]},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":\"MerkleProof\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/Hashes.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8cbd338f083224b4b6f0ff42cbda641a0a6c31ffcdca197452b97fe4d0918269\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f517dec5ba0c6491395acbf7f1d621f4e89e8f218bf5303c867b1c5ad70c6b11\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWmXHRLEw8W6ckth7NyYTU88YfvuS7xSsfae5ksL8qNUe\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x36a0c409c437a753cac9b92b75f93b0fbe92803bf2c8ff1517e54b247f166134\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0f91ba472de411aa557cdbf6560c40750d87bd11c9060bc04d2ba7119af9d5a6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQjtYo2i7dDvzCEzZ67bDoNSG4RrwMoxPWuqFmX5Xzpuw\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol":{"ERC165":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes4","name":"interfaceId","type":"bytes4"}],"name":"supportsInterface","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"supportsInterface(bytes4)":"01ffc9a7"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes4\",\"name\":\"interfaceId\",\"type\":\"bytes4\"}],\"name\":\"supportsInterface\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.
